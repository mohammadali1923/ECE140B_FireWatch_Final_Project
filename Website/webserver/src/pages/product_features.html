  <h2> Machine Vision <br> <a>We're using Machine Vision to classify smoke and fire, and alert human operators when those categories have been detected. Then, operators can quickly review the footage, and call for help if neccessary! </a> </h2>
  
  <h2> Remote operation <br> <a>You will be able to control the drone completely remotely through this website, simply being cloe enough to WiFi will work! This way, missions can be launched without lengthy setup or travel to the drone itself! </a> </h2>
 
  <h2> Long battery life <br> <a>The drone protype will be able to get around 15 minutes of flight time, enough to travel around 8 miles. This gives the operator a huge cone of vision, allowing them to see smoke long before people on the ground notice.</a> </h2>

   <h2> Modularity <br> <a>Multiple drones can be controlled at once from a single account, making it possible to blanket a huge area of forest or rural fields.</a> </h2>
